	/* from the specs...
       In order for the club to keep track of contacts, there will be a contacts table of all of the people that are in the club records including the personâ€™s name, a unique PID (Person IDentifier), and some basic contact information (address, e-mail, phone).  This portion of the database may contain both members and non-members. It is simply a way of associating other records with a person, and also a way for club members to look up contact info. This PID field is a primary key that points back to a particular person and will often be used as a foreign key elsewhere in the database.
