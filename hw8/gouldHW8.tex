The attached screenshots show 2 queries that I ran, and the times that I ran them at.
The client page is called "client.jsp", and the server is "server.jsp".  
I put both of these into my var/tomcat6/webapps/ROOT folder.
Both jsp pages are modified versions of the example code that the professor gave us, with only minor modifications.

The first query that I ran is from HW7, and the second is just the most basic of select statements.
It would appear that I can make proper queries, as the assignment requires.

As a side note, if an invalid query is entered, the application will fail and go to the tomcat error page.
